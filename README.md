## 🎮 What is Bean Clicker?

**Bean Clicker** is a fun, addictive, and visually polished **idle clicker game** built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Your goal is simple: **click the bean to harvest beans** and unlock a vast array of upgrades to boost your bean production both actively (by clicking) and passively (over time).

Inspired by classic clicker games, Bean Clicker offers a satisfying progression system, a wide variety of upgrades, and a beautiful, responsive UI.

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. **Click the Bean**  
   Tap or click the giant bean to collect beans. Each click gives you beans, and you can increase this amount by purchasing upgrades.

2. **Buy Upgrades**  
   Spend your beans on upgrades in three categories:
   - **Clicking**: Boost beans per click.
   - **Production**: Increase beans per second (passive income).
   - **Advanced**: Unlock powerful late-game upgrades for massive bean production.

3. **Progress & Unlock**  
   Each upgrade unlocks the next in its category. Some upgrades are locked until you buy the previous one.

4. **Save & Reset**  
   - **Save Game**: Click the 💾 button to save your progress to your browser.
   - **Reset Game**: Click the 🔄 button to start over (this cannot be undone).

5. **Cheat Code**  
   Press the `P` key for a huge bean bonus (for testing or fun).
